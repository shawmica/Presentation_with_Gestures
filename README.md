# Presentation_with_Gestures
I’ve developed a revolutionary hand gesture-controlled slide presentation tool using OpenCV and cvzone's HandTrackingModule. Here’s what it can do:

🖐️ Seamless slide navigation with simple and more efficient hand gestures:
   - Move your left hand in the left half of the live video screen to navigate the whole slide window.
   - Move your right hand in the right half of the live video screen to navigate the whole slide window.
 
   - Use your right thumb to navigate to the previous slide.
   - Use your right pinky finger to navigate to the next slide.
   - For left-handed users, use your left pinky finger to navigate to the previous slide.
   - Use your left thumb to navigate to the next slide.

✏️ Real-time drawing and annotation directly on the slides using your index finger.

🔄 Easy erasing of annotations with intuitive gesture recognition:
  -  Use a specific three finger hand gesture to undo your last annotation effortlessly.

👆 Use a pointing gesture to highlight areas on your slides for added emphasis.

📹 Picture-in-picture display with a live video feed of the presenter in the top-right corner for a more engaging presentation.
In there I used a green horizontal line, that the gestures for navigating previous and next slide will only work above the line, It will reduce any unwanted intrusions during the presentation.
